# Cartoonify

Cartoonify is a Python-based project that transforms ordinary images into cartoon-like versions using computer vision techniques. This project leverages image processing algorithms such as edge detection, color quantization, and smoothing filters to produce an artistic rendition of the original image.

## Features

- **Image Cartoonification:** Convert any image into a cartoon style by detecting edges and applying color smoothing.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Easily tweak parameters such as edge detection thresholds and smoothing levels.
- **Simple Interface:** Designed for ease of use even for beginners in image processing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yxshee/Cartoonify.git
   cd Cartoonify
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the cartoonification process from the command line or integrate the code into your own projects. For example:

```bash
python cartoonify.py --input path/to/input_image.jpg --output path/to/output_image.jpg
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--input`  
  Specify the path to the input image.

- `--output`  
  Specify the path where the cartoonified image should be saved.

- _Additional arguments_  
  (If applicable, list other parameters such as edge threshold values or smoothing parameters.)
